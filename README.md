# Clichaos
A new fun and chaotic game by VGames.

Clichaos is made out of 2 words, click + chaos = clichaos

The motive of this game is to just click buttons. That's it. But the thing is that it is not going to be easy.
Buttons a cunningly smart. They can hide, run, disguise and do whatever you can think of!
